                                The Chinese considered 30 to be a number of cunning and strategy.
                              Rooted in the ancient text The Thirty - Stratagems, it symbolizes 
                             the wisdom of knowing when to strike, and when to retreat. In this game, 
                            30 isn’t just a number — it’s your target, your challenge, your battlefield.
                          Draw your cards wisely. Outsmart the odds. Can you reach 36 without going over?</pre>

    <p><pre><h4>Rules:</h4>
    <ul><li>Achieve a total of exactly 30 to win the game.</li>
    <li>Exceeding a total of 30 results in an automatic loss.</li>
    <li>If your total remains below 30, you may continue drawing cards in hopes of a 30.</li></ul></pre></p>

<!--mention in the website that the ace is number 1 in this game, and JQK are all being considered as the 10th value -->
<!--so that makes up 1(A),2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and 10(J or Q or K)-->
<!--but since there already exists a 10 numerical value and the JQK are also considered as 10, then it's best to assign the A as the 11th value in our game(see the ss) -->
